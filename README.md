# Y.A.T.R.A_Yielding Advanced Research and Traffic Analysis_
YATRA is a project developed in my 3rd semester to explore the dynamics of traffic flow and make predictive analyses using data collected from tolls. This project marks my first attempt at using regression models in Python, specifically polynomial regression, to analyze current traffic patterns and forecast future trends. Through YATRA, I aim to gain hands-on experience with predictive modeling while addressing real-world traffic challenges.


##Running the Application 
1. Install the Python Idle [Click Here (Python)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    Ensure you have administrative privileges while installing dependencies.
    Set the Python environment in your system's PATH for seamless execution.
2. To install MySQL Workbench, click the link below: [Install MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
3. Insall All required modules using command promt by using the following commands
    ```bash
         pip install numpy
         pip install Pillow
         pip install opencv-python
         pip install matplotlib
         pip install pandas
         pip install scikit-learn
         pip install mysql-connector-python
 **tkinter** (included with Python standard library, no need to install separately)
 
 4. Open SQL Workbench and create a database with command
 
                CREATE DATABASE yatra;
5. Now run yatrasql.py from SQL Database Creation to create all the required tables in the database
6. Finally run yatra.py from the main folder.
