# Y.A.T.R.A_Yielding Advanced Research and Traffic Analysis_
YATRA is a project developed in my 3rd semester to explore the dynamics of traffic flow and make predictive analyses using data collected from tolls. This project marks my first attempt at using regression models in Python, specifically polynomial regression, to analyze current traffic patterns and forecast future trends. Through YATRA, I aim to gain hands-on experience with predictive modeling while addressing real-world traffic challenges.
